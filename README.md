This project is based on breast cancer prediction.
Breast cancer prediction with Machine Learning
This is a small project to test custom algorithms on the dataset for breast cancer. In this repository you will find necessary information to get you going with these 3 classifcation algorithms (KNN, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes)

Dataset
This is Wisconsin Dataset for breast cancer but you will find it inside the root folder of this project.
